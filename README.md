# USGS Earthquake Data

The USGS provides earthquake data that is updated every five minutes. The map below displays significant earthquakes from the past 30 days. The size of the circle is determined by the magnitude of the earthquake and the color is determined by the depth of the earthquake. The map was created using Leaflet.
